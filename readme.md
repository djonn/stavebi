# Stave Bi, bare p√• Dansk

The purpose of this project is mostly to play with data a bit and try to generate fun letters combinations to play a Danish version of The New York Times word game [Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee).

## Setup

```sh
dotnet tool restore
```

This will install the EntityFramework command line tool into the project

The tool will allow you to create migration scripts using this command
```sh
dotnet ef migrations add <MIGRATION_NAME>
```

## How to run (local)

Requires dotnet + node + npm

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build

cd ..
dotnet build --project src/SpellingBee.csproj
```

You will then need to run a couple of http requests to seed the database and generate some games

```log
http://localhost:5209/admin/seed-words
http://localhost:5209/admin/generate
```


## How to run (in docker)

```sh
docker build -t stavebi .
docker run -d --name=stavebi --rm -p 5209:8080 -v ./db:/db stavebi
```

## TODO

### Need

- [FEATURE] Previous game selector (FE)
- [FEATURE] Only add `/debug` and (maybe) `/admin` endpoints when NOT running in production

### Ideas

- Admin page for seeing the average word score for a set of letters
  * Can this somehow be used for difficulty level?
- If no db is found on startup: create one, seed with words, generate a couple of games
- Host it somewhere online for people to try it out
- Have toasts float on top of the remaining page, instead of possibly moving the hive
- Recreate hive so I haven't just stolen it
- Auth for admin pages
- Refactor to use static file hosting, only using dotnet to build a set of json files
- Add button to shuffle letters
